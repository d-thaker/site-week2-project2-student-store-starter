              The codepath student store offers great products at great prices
              from a great team and for a great cause.<br></br> We've searched
              far and wide for items that perk the interests of even the most
              eccentric students and decided to offer them all here in one
              place. All proceeds go towards bringing high quality CS education
              to college students around the country.
